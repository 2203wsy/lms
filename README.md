# LAN Management System (LMS)
LMS (LAN Management System) is a comprehensive suite of applications<!-- by Ê¢ÅÂÜ∞‰∏Ω--> designed for the management of LAN networks. Its primary objective is to deliver optimal service to customers<!-- by Ê¢ÅÂÜ∞‰∏Ω-->, as exemplified by large Internet Service Providers (ISPs)<!-- by Ê¢ÅÂÜ∞‰∏Ω-->. LMS is developed using PHP, Perl, and C programming languages and supports MySQL or PostgreSQL as database backends. The current feature set includes: a customer database (storing names, addresses, phone numbers, comments, etc.), an inventory system for tracking computers (IP and MAC addresses), a streamlined financial system tailored for network operations (including financial balances, invoices, and email notifications), an automated billing schedule, the ability to generate a wide range of configuration files (e.g., ipchains/iptables firewall scripts, DHCP daemon configurations, DNS zone files for bind, /etc/ethers entries, oident, htb settings, etc.), bandwidth consumption visualization per host, a request tracking system (Helpdesk functionality), and a scheduling organizer.<!-- by Ê¢ÅÂÜ∞‰∏Ω-->
 # LMS Project Background
LMS (Local Network Management System) is a comprehensive management tool designed for enterprises, schools, government institutions and other local area network environments, aiming to improve the efficiency of LAN operation and maintenance, ensure network security, and optimize resource allocation. Through centralized management, real-time monitoring and intelligent control of devices, users, traffic and permissions in the LAN are realized.<!--by Ê¢ÅÂÜ∞‰∏Ω-->
# Future Development Trends 
- AI Integration: Leverage machine learning algorithms to forecast traffic surges and dynamically adjust network policies for optimal performance.  
- Cloud-Edge Collaboration: In conjunction with the cloud management platform, achieve unified governance over cross-regional local area networks (LANs).  
- IoT Expansion: Facilitate the connection and administration of emerging terminal devices, including 5G and LoRa technologies.  
- Automated Operations and Maintenance: Minimize manual intervention through self-healing scripts designed for fault resolution.  <!--by Ê¢ÅÂÜ∞‰∏Ω-->

# Project Main Function Screenshots
This file docgen.sh is a Bash script, whose main function is to automatically generate documents in different formats (HTML, TXT, or all) from SGML source files based on the input parameters (html, txt, or all). It calls tools like jade and lynx to convert SGML files into HTML or TXT formats, and moves or renames the generated files to the specified directory. The script supports three usages:
html: Generate HTML format documents
txt: Generate plain text format documents
all: Generate both HTML and plain text documents
If the parameter is incorrect, it will output usage instructions.
