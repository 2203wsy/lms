# Lan Management System (LMS)
LMS (LAN Management System) is a comprehensive suite of applications<!-- by 梁冰丽--> designed for the management of LAN networks. Its primary objective is to deliver optimal service to customers<!-- by 梁冰丽-->, as exemplified by large Internet Service Providers (ISPs)<!-- by 梁冰丽-->. LMS is developed using PHP, Perl, and C programming languages and supports MySQL or PostgreSQL as database backends. The current feature set includes: a customer database (storing names, addresses, phone numbers, comments, etc.), an inventory system for tracking computers (IP and MAC addresses), a streamlined financial system tailored for network operations (including financial balances, invoices, and email notifications), an automated billing schedule, the ability to generate a wide range of configuration files (e.g., ipchains/iptables firewall scripts, DHCP daemon configurations, DNS zone files for bind, /etc/ethers entries, oident, htb settings, etc.), bandwidth consumption visualization per host, a request tracking system (Helpdesk functionality), and a scheduling organizer.<!-- by 梁冰丽-->
